/* 
 * NEW CSS - Your Refactored Version
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Use CSS nesting to organize your styles
 * 2. Replace repetitive selectors with :is() 
 * 3. Use :where() for base styles with zero specificity
 * 4. Implement :has() for conditional styling (cards with images)
 * 5. Use :not() for exclusions where appropriate
 * 
 * Goal: Recreate the exact same visual appearance as styles-old.css
 * but with cleaner, more maintainable code using modern CSS techniques.
